## A whimsical twist on hover transitions

`Hover animations` are a great way to make an application feel dynamic and responsive. It's a small thing, but it's exactly the kind of little detail that, in aggregate, can make a product feel great.

It utilizes the spring-physics animation library called "React Spring". It offers a modern hook-based API, and unbeatable performance.
